Binary code: ones and zeros: computer language
Code: Source code: This is a code written using a programming language 

Execute: executor: execution: Run 
Compile: compiler: compilation: Check if there is any syntax error in the code

JavaScript vs other languages 


ASCII table: 

Automation tools that are demand: Cypress & Playwright 
Selenium demand is decreasing

50-60 percent of the jobs -> Selenium

Cypress -> 10-15 percent
Playwright -> 10-15 percent 

10 percent: The other tools


Statement: Any line of code that is written with a programming language

Some statement examples
console.log('Hello'); // This is JS or TS  statement
System.out.println("Hello"); // This is Java statement
Console.WriteLine("Hello"); // This is C# statement


COMMENTS: are used for short descriptions.

// used for single line COMMENTS

/*
    Multi-line
    comments
*/

VARIABLES:
-it is a special container that stores a value
-you can change the initial value ? 


var-let-const 

Before 2015 (ES6)
-There was only var keyword used for variables 
-You can re-assign values to var variables 

After 2015 (ES6) 
-JS introduced 2 new keywords: let and const to be used instead of var keyword 
-let can be re-assigned with a new value
-const is used for constants and cannot be re-assigned

-let can be declared and assigned a value later
-let variable value is going to be undefined if it is declared but not assigned with any value
-const cannot be declared without a value and MUST always be initialized with an initial value


Data Types:
string: is a text data type which can be stored in variables using single or double quotes
number: is number data which can be stored in variables without quotes

5 + 5 = 10
'5' + '5' = '55'
'abc' + 'xyz' = 'abcxyz'

Concatenation: combining multiple strings together using + operator 

number + number : arithmetic operation 
string + string : Concatenation
string + number : 

'5' + 3 = '53'
'5' + 3 + 2 = '532'
'5' + (3 + 2) = '55'
2 + 1 + '0' = '30'

'Hello' + 'World' = 'HelloWorld'


Variable Naming: How should we name our variables?
firstName

Convention: it is not a written rule but followed by all the coders/programmers



let age;                    true
let AGE;                    true but not preferred
let shift$;                 true 
let number of students;     false
let _firstLetter;           true 
let 8students;              false 
let isWheatherSnowing#;     false 
let @balance;               false



const name, age;            false
let n1 = 45, n2;            true
const num1 = 45, num2;      false 
let x, let y;               false / Error             
let a; let b;               true but not preferred
let i1; i2;                 false / looks fine for compilation but we got Error when we execute
