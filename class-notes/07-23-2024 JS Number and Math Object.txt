Falsy values:
false 
0
''
null
undefined
NaN


-Number Object is more complex than the primitive number.
-It is built-in object.
-It has its own properties and functions. 

Properties:
MAX_VALUE
MIN_VALUE
MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
MIN_SAFE_INTEGER
POSITIVE_INFINITY
NEGATIVE_INFINITY
NaN 
EPSILON


property: the object information (what it has)
function: the object behaviors (what it does)


property = state = field = instance variables
function = method = behavior


Can we call a function without an object? 

isNaN()

Number.toString()
Number.toFixed()



JavaScript provides us some global functions you can invoke without referencing from any objects.

isNaN()
parseFloat()
parseInt()
isFinite()
